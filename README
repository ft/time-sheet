    Time-Sheet management for Schemers
  --------------------------------------


1. Introduction
---------------

At work, we're using Redmine to keep track of time spent on tasks, projects,
issues, projects. All that. Naturally, I want my personal copy of time data
from that database. It's not like I am expecting to be screwed over, but I
want a copy all same, if just to survive Redmine bugs or burning buildings.

To that end I take snapshots of my Redmine time-sheet for a week every Friday,
just before I am about to leave. One week is a time-frame I can still tell if
a data set is sane. I couldn't do that for a month or even a year.

The export from Redmine is a csv file, that the (time-sheet csv-import) module
of this project will turn into an S-expression data set, which is much more
verbose, featureful and robust compared to csv. The rest of the project works
on the S-expression data rather than the csv export from Redmine.

With that in place, this project provides a library that allows to write small
scripts that produce LaTeX output, that you can process by lualatex to generate
PDF versions of the time data.

It sports a bunch of frontend modules like (time-sheet script) and (time-sheet
render), date-math, holiday computation, file-system utilities, calendar
generation with support for multiple different types of vacation.

The system is written in GNU Guile Scheme and thus the scripts written using
the library are as well. The library is covered by LGPL3+, of which you can
find a copy in the LICENCE and LICENCE.GPL files in the distribution.


2. Requirements
---------------

  - GNU Guile Version 2.x
  - Pandoc for building the reference manual in doc/.


3. Features
-----------

  - Importing CSV time data exports into S-Expressions
  - Calendar generation from imported time data
  - Vacation types: Regular leave, compensatory days, extra leave
  - Calendar export as S-Expressions or LaTeX documents
  - Frontend modules to increase ease of use

Consult the reference manual in doc/ and the example script in examples/ for
more detailed infomation on how the use the library.
